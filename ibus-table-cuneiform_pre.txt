### Layout
### This table can be used with any layout capable of typing ASCII.
### Therefore, we should not require a special layout like ‚Äúus‚Äù.
LAYOUT = default

MAX_KEY_LENGTH = 100

### Use auto_commit mode as default
AUTO_COMMIT = TRUE

AUTO_SELECT = TRUE

### Use full width punctuation by default
DEF_FULL_WIDTH_PUNCT = FALSE
### Not use full width letter by default
DEF_FULL_WIDTH_LETTER = FALSE

### Whether user are allow to define phrase, default is true
### You have to define the word construction rules below.
### For input methods which do not input phrases, set this to False
USER_CAN_DEFINE_PHRASE = FALSE

### Rules for constructing user defined phrase
### "ce" stands for "ci equal", a Chinese English :), means "phrase length
### equal to", thus ce2 -> phrase length equal to 2; and "ca" means "phrase
### length equal or above", so ca4 -> phrase length equal or above 4.
### p21 -> the 1st key of 2nd character in the phrase, and so on.
### Each rule separate via ";". 
### Example below is a complete rule-set, 
### becuase [2,2] ‚à© [3,3] ‚à© [4,+‚àû] = [2,+‚àû], which is the range of length
### of phrase. This have to be satisfied if you need ibus-table to build up
### your own inputed phrase via your daily using.
#RULES = ce2:p11+p12+p21+p22;ce3:p11+p21+p22+p31;ca4:p11+p21+p31+p41
